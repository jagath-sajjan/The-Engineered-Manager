# The Engineered Manager 
> *Bridging the gap between Code, Data, and Strategy.*

## Progress Day-3: https://everydayupdates.tiiny.site/

## 🚀 Mission
This repository documents my framework for **Technical Leadership**. 
It is not just about writing code; it is about engineering the **process** of software delivery. 

I combine **Full Stack Engineering** (to build), **Power BI** (to measure), and **Agile Methodologies** (to execute) to create predictable, high-velocity engineering environments.
